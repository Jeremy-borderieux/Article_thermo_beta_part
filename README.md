### Abstract:

The ongoing climate change is triggering plant community thermophilization. Such selection process towards warm-adapted species may also lead to biotic homogenization. The link between those two processes and the community dynamic driving them (colonization and extinction) remain unknow but are critical to understand community response under rapid environmental change.
We used 12,764 pairs of plots to study plant community change in 16 years of rising temperatures in 80 forest ecoregions of France. We computed thermophilization and Δβ-diversity (homogenization) for each ecoregion, and partitioned these changes into extinction and colonization dynamics for cold and warm-adapted species. 
Forest understory communities thermophilized on average by 0.12 °C decade<sup>-1</sup> and up to 0.20 °C decade<sup>-1</sup> in warm ecoregions. This rate was entirely driven by extinction dynamics. Extinction of cold-adapted species was a driver of homogenization, but it was compensated by the colonization of rare species and the extinction of common species. This results in a lack of apparent trend of homogenization. 
An extinction-driven thermophilization is concerning as it reflects the dieback of current species rather than adaptation of understory to climate change. These results suggest that a future loss of biodiversity and a delayed biotic homogenization should be considered.
